When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I can think of three reasons:
      1) to facilitate collaboration, where your team is using GitHub
      2) to put your files online, so that you could access them from another machine
      3) to publish work for others to see

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Same reason you want to commit changes manually rather than automatically.
    Perhaps you are working on a new branch while others are also editing.
        You don't want their code to create conflicts with yours while you are working on it.
        Instead you want to resolve collisions at the time you choose to commit, 
            so that you can choose how to resolve them, if necessary.
